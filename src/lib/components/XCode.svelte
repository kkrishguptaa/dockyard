      This website has been built for HackClub. HackClub hosts a bunch of
      programs called <abbr title="You Ship We Ship">YSWS</abbr>. This website
      allows you to login with your HackClub ID and find YSWS(s) to participate
      in. The website also features a checklist functionality for YSWS(s). You
      can add your own YSWS(s) to the website as drafts and get them approved to
      have them display!
    </p>
    <p>
      The website has been built with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
